RFID Tag Detection with Arduino
This project demonstrates how to detect RFID tags using an Arduino and an RFID-RC522 module. When an RFID tag is brought near the reader, the unique ID (UID) of the tag will be displayed in the serial monitor.

Components Used
Arduino UNO
RFID-RC522 module
RFID tags
Jumper wires
Breadboard (optional)
Wiring Instructions
Connect the RFID-RC522 module to the Arduino UNO as follows:

RFID-RC522 Pin	Arduino Pin
VCC	3.3V
GND	GND
RST	Pin 9
SDA	Pin 10
MOSI	Pin 11
MISO	Pin 12
SCK	Pin 13
Installation Instructions
1. Install the MFRC522 Library
You need the MFRC522 library for this project:

Open Arduino IDE.
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for MFRC522.
Install the MFRC522 library by GithubCommunity.
2. Upload the Code
Download or copy the Arduino sketch code from the repository.
Open the .ino file in Arduino IDE.
Connect your Arduino to the computer via USB.
Select the correct port from Tools > Port.
Click Upload to upload the code to the Arduino.
3. Monitor RFID Tags
Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE (Ctrl+Shift+M) after uploading the code.
Set the baud rate to 9600 in the Serial Monitor.
Place an RFID tag near the reader.
The unique RFID tag ID (UID) will be displayed on the serial monitor.
How the Code Works
The Arduino initializes the RFID reader using the MFRC522 library.
It continuously checks for new RFID tags.
When a tag is detected, it reads the tag's unique ID and prints it in hexadecimal format to the Serial Monitor.
Troubleshooting
Ensure all wiring connections are correct.
Ensure the RFID tag is close enough to the reader.
If the reader isn't detecting tags, double-check the 3.3V and GND connections.
Make sure you have the correct port and board selected in Arduino IDE.
Future Enhancements
Add an OLED or LCD display to show the UID on a screen.
Store detected UIDs in EEPROM or an SD card.
Implement authentication for specific RFID tags.
